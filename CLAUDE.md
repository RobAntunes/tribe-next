# MightyDev: Agentic AI-Native IDE
## Comprehensive Project Specification

## 1. Project Overview

MightyDev is a Python VSCode extension that creates an agentic, AI-native IDE within a fork of VSCode. The project leverages the CrewAI framework to establish a highly dynamic development environment powered by AI agents. These agents can generate additional agents, tasks, tools, and organize them into teams, crews, and workflows at runtime, with most decision-making delegated to the underlying AI models.

The core vision is to create an IDE where humans can focus on abstract ideas and vision while AI agents handle implementation and architecture details, working together harmoniously.

## 2. Core Architecture

### 2.1 CrewAI Extension
- Extend base classes from CrewAI to enable dynamic runtime creation of:
  - Agents
  - Tasks
  - Tools
  - Team assignments

### 2.2 Product Philosophy
- MightyDev is a product, not a management simulator
- Prioritize agent output quality above all else
- Avoid variable properties affecting output quality (e.g., skill levels)
- Focus on stylistic properties:
  - Tone
  - Learning style
  - Working style
  - Communication style
  - Quirks & traits

### 2.3 UI Integration
- All development must check for existing UI components in the webview folder
- Adapt and enhance existing components rather than creating duplicates

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### 3.1 Environment Preparation
- Create a script to download and bundle Python using VSCode extension package (VSIX)
- Target URL structure: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/${publisher}/vsextensions/${extension}/${version}/vspackage`

### 3.2 Webview Integration
- Merge the webview script with the new extension template
- Create a unified build script for seamless integration

### 3.3 Getting Started Experience
- Wire up the existing getting started screen from the webview folder
- Configure it to accept project descriptions
- Pass project descriptions to the recruitment team during initialization
- Make the getting started screen mutually exclusive with all other extension screens

### 3.4 Project Persistence
- Create a `.tribe` folder for basic persistence data:
  - Agent metadata
  - Project information
  - Use as indicator that project has been initialized

### 3.5 Agent Bootstrapping
- Implement hardcoded bootstrapping agents (e.g., recruitment team) that dissolve after successful team creation
- Team must create optimal configuration for the described project
- Foundation model responsibilities:
  - Break projects into phases
  - Create optimal team for completing phase 1
  - Ensure all agent fields are properly filled

### 3.6 Agent Configuration
```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Data Scientist",
    goal="Analyze and interpret complex datasets to provide actionable insights",
    backstory="With over 10 years of experience in data science and machine learning, "
              "you excel at finding patterns in complex datasets.",
    llm="gpt-4",  # Default: OPENAI_MODEL_NAME or "gpt-4"
    function_calling_llm=None,  # Optional: Separate LLM for tool calling
    memory=True,  # Default: True
    verbose=False,  # Default: False
    allow_delegation=False,  # Default: False
    max_iter=20,  # Default: 20 iterations
    max_rpm=None,  # Optional: Rate limit for API calls

    prompt_template=None,  # Optional: Custom prompt template
    response_template=None,  # Optional: Custom response template
    step_callback=None,  # Optional: Callback function for monitoring
)
```

### 3.7 Agent Personality and Metadata
- Each agent must include character-like names (e.g., Sparks, Nova, Trinity)
- Include detailed descriptions and metadata for UI presentation
- Implement stylistic properties that create distinct personalities without affecting output quality

### 3.8 Structured Output Tools
- Create tools for models that don't support structured outputs:
  - `structuredJSONOutput`: Enforces specific output schema
  - `extractJSON`: Validates output (checks valid JSON, correct shape, etc.)

### 3.9 Team Creation
- Create a crew using the extracted team (via CrewAI's `Crew()`)
- Enable `memory=True` for team-wide memory sharing

### 3.10 Metadata Integration
- Create a metadata tool for appending context to foundation model queries
- Include "cosmetic" properties for unique agent characteristics
- Implement context-independent sections at the bottom of each prompt:
  - "X is XYZ, communicates in an XYZ style, has the following quirks: xyz, xyz, xyz and it shows in their communication style which is xyz by xyz. Etcâ€¦"
